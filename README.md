# Optimal-Risky-Portfolio-Function


The optrisky function calculates the optimal risky portfolio for a given target expected return using mean-variance optimization. It takes as input a target return (targmu), a vector of expected returns (mu), and a variance-covariance matrix (Sig) of asset returns. The function applies the analytical solution to the constrained optimization problem where the goal is to minimize portfolio variance subject to achieving the target expected return and full investment (weights summing to one). It computes intermediate values (A, B, C, D) used in the Markowitz optimization framework and then derives the optimal portfolio weights (w) as a linear combination of two vectors that satisfy the constraints. Finally, it calculates the standard deviation (Stdev) of the resulting portfolio, which represents its total risk. This function is useful for tracing out the efficient frontier or selecting a portfolio that meets a specific return objective.
